# Simple Matrix Forward Bot

Actually, VERY simple bot that just re-sends an event from one chat to another and back. May be used to "proxy" your messages to another person or bridge through fake account. Yep, that's just it. Prebuilt Docker images are available on Docker Hub as [kamehb/simple-matrix-forward-bot](https://hub.docker.com/r/kamehb/simple-matrix-forward-bot)
